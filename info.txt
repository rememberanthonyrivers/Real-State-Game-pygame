Game Name : "Club Tycoon Gem Hustle"

Key Tools and Libraries:
Game Development Framework:

Pygame: Ideal for 2D games like the puzzle aspect of your game. It provides functionality for rendering graphics, handling input, and managing game loops.
Arcade: A modern alternative to Pygame, offering better performance and simpler APIs for 2D games.
Database for Player Progression:

SQLite: A lightweight database included with Python for storing player data, like club upgrades and gem scores.
PostgreSQL or MySQL: If scalability is a concern, these databases can handle more extensive player data.
Web Framework (Optional):

Flask/Django: To add online features like leaderboards, multiplayer, or connecting with real-world venues.
Graphics and Animations:

Use Pillow for basic image manipulation.
For more complex 3D features (like AR/VR), you'd need to integrate Python with tools like Blender or game engines like Unity (via Python bindings or plugins).
Real-Time Features:

WebSockets with libraries like Socket.IO (via Python's websocket or asyncio) can enable real-time updates, such as online interactions between players.
AR/VR Integration:

Python is not ideal for building AR/VR directly, but it can act as the backend for AR/VR features. Use libraries like OpenCV for basic AR or integrate with engines like Unity for more advanced features.
